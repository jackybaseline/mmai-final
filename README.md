Ideas:

1.Image retrieval for "出清台大"

Origin text retrieval is not good enough.

2.Recognize "beauty"

Data: Posts in board of "Beauty" on ptt, more push is more beautiful.


3.Gesture recognition on drone

It is quite hard... Use people detection to cut people to another single image first, then recognition his gesture in top-left corner on it.

Data: We have drone, but...
